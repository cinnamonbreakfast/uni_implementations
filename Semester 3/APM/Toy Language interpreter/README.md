## Unmerged updates

There is a separate directory on this project where numerous statements and expressions have been added, but being on testing phase, the project was not merged with this one. Source can be easily found [HERE](https://github.com/cinnamonbreakfast/uni_implementations/tree/master/APM/Toy%20Language%20on%20Steroids/src). The unmerged projects contains the following updates/improvements:
* Console
* Wait statement
* Switch statement
* Repeat until statement
* For
* Acquire/Release statement (for multi-threading and syncing)
* Semaphore
* Barrier
* Fork
* Conditional assignment statement
* Await statement
* Logical Expression
* NOT expression
* Relational expression
* CountDown Latch
* Cyclic barrier

A certain syntax and editor has not been developed yet, nor an interpretor available for terminal.

## About

This is an assignment for Advanced Programming methods where we mostly write projects in Java (but C# and Scala as well). This project, as the title says, is a Toy Language interpreter, based only on Java, starting with basic statements and types up until multithreading and heap. Beside basic implementations from my UNI assignments, I am planning to lead this project to a certain point where everybody can compile code in terminal using any IDE. The assignments are based on hard-coded examples and not using any kind of file handling & compiling.

The main idea of this project is to exercise Java skills where the scenario is other that a basic management system for people, cars, et cetera.

## How does it work

Trying to avoid getting deeper into technical terms and stuff, this interpreter _handles_ a class, named **ProgramStatement** which contains instructions/statements to be executed, as well as a repo for code, ADTs, Heap, SymbolTable and so on. **IStatement** class is built, most of the time, like a binary tree, or more exactly in a _"telescopic"_ form, so we can achieve a well-linked syntax, executed step-by-step (in depth).

**_TBA_**: Interpreting a file, custom syntax, compiling to binary.

## Updates

### 1.3 - Why
* Fork statement, multi-threading
* New structure for Controller, ProgramState, statements

### 1.2 - What the actual f...
* Added Ref type (pointer in Heap)
* Ref can Ref ref a Ref that refs a Ref that refs a ...
* Heap handling functions (new, read, write)
* Garbage collecter
* While statement

### 1.1 - Things are getting serious
* Added file handling
* Added execution log to log files
* Log on each step (debugging)
* Logical Expressions and Boolean Type & Value

### 1.0 - Beginning
* ProgramState
* Repository
* ADTs
* Types
* Values
* Basic statements and expressions

## Future updates

Can't predict sh~t, GUI for sure
