                <h2>What's up with the new Dodge Demon?</h2>
                <p>The new <b>Challenger SRT Demon</b> is the most powerful muscle car on the road thanks to the 6.2-liter Hemi Demon V8 engine that creates 840 horsepower and 700 pound-feet of torque. This beast of a muscle car can get to 60 miles per hour in just 2.3 seconds while doing the quarter mile in about 9.6 seconds.<br><br>
                    The Demon is priced at $84,995, very fair for this level of performance, and the company is going far out of its way to ensure that dealers won't price gouge.</p>

                <h2>Legal on the streets</h2>
                <p>It's easy to forget, but important to remember, that this is a machine you can take on the street. To get the full 840 horsepower, you'll need race gas, but the car will still do 808 hp on whatever high-octane you can find down at the corner. A push of a button on the dash toggles between the two. There's also an Eco setting and a password-protected Valet mode for those moments when you have to turn over the keys to someone you don't entirely trust. Like the 707-hp Hellcat, the Demon also comes with two keys that trigger different power levels. The black key is limited to 500 horses -- the same number of ponies you get in Eco mode -- and the red key unlocks the car's full potential.</p>

                <h2>Not just a hotter Hellcat</h2>
                <p>When Dodge first introduced its Hellcats for 2015, nobody knew quite what to expect. Magazine covers and YouTube videos were all but assured, but actual sales? Yet enthusiasts lapped them up faster than Dodge could build them, pointing to a robust appetite for 707-horsepower SRT Chargers and Challengers.</p>
